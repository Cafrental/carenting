          As the Carenting page is an information society servicea means of
          communication between passengers and drivers, we cannot guarantee or
          take any responsibility for the quality or the absence of defects in
          the provision of transport services. As the usage of Carenting page
          for requesting transport services depends on the behaviour of the

          available for the provision of the transport services. The Carenting

          service was ordered.The Carenting page is provided on an "as is" and
